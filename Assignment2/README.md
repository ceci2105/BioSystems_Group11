# Setup & Imports
We take the working SIRD model code from the practical and use it as a backbone of all further calculations.

# Part 1: Parameter Analysis Function
The function uses the SIRD model and tests the simulation outcome of 5, hardcoded, recovery rates values as specifiied in the instructions. For each recovery rate it creates a subplot showing its epidemic curves: Evolution of the number of Suscebtible, Infected, Recovered & Dead among the simulation population. Furthermore, for each recovery rate It also creates a record in the 'results' dataframe, which stores the following information: ['gamma', 'R0', 'peak_infected', 'peak_day', 'total_deaths'].

After running all 5 scenarios the functions dispplays the final visualization of all 5 epidemic curves and outputs the result dataframe. We then print the result dataframe and also visualize its findings, showing how each of the result data columns changes with respect to recovery rate (gamma).
